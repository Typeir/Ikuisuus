# The duties of my lord

---
The starry skies of the Pyknos rainforest do not feel as homely as they usually do today.
For the first time in a while, the **Light of Creation** has not been visible for over two nights,
and the **opaline belt's** shine has obscured the master's astroscope, along with his acquaintances.

*Master Anaximandro* has been away for a while; in his absence, **Aristides** has been taking care of the stead.
But almost half a tenday ago, **Aristides** left without a sign. We believe he must have gone out in the night to fetch
Master's beacon, so he can safely find his way back now that the preparations are in order. Tomorrow is a special day;
Master's research has been proven true, and it will be put into action.
*We knows not of magicks, for that is Anaximandro's realm. Aristides seems to know a fair bit more, but he never shares.*

Before you go to sleep, you find a letter-contract resting by your bedside; you do not know how it got here, but the writing is pristine.
Maybe some other servant or worker left it here in preparation for tomorrow.

*To my beloved companions and coworkers*

*As it stands, we have to manage the day of morrow entirely by ourselves. Tomorrow midnight when master returns, the stead must be
pristine; he is not cruel, but we would want not to disappoint him.*

*The tasks remaining for the day are the following:*

- **Clean the stables:**

  Only three horses left in the stable this week, now that **Aristides** took his.
  Should be easy to do.

- **Repair, sharpen, and beat into shape the damaged silverware:**

  A few tools are missing, so we might have to go into the woods and improvise. Things seem to have gone missing this week.

- **Clean the upper chambers:**

  A lot of dirt flew in during this last tenday; the weather has been unreasonably windy and moisty for the end of summer,
  even in this already windy and humid region.

- **Prepare dinner:**

  A trip to the cellar is granted. Lots of food remaining, but we will have to forage herbs, mushrooms, and the like.
  *Anaximandro likes chicken of the woods. Reminds him of the cycle of life and death; he finds solace in them.*

- **Remove the dead crops:**

  Crops fell ill two or three phases ago; we know not why, but it might have been the unusual humidity.
  We should plant some back.

- **Unclog the well:**

  The well has been clogged for a bit; we should go down with the pulley and check what is causing it.
  Fallen leaves are usually the culprit.

- **Fit new door frames:**

  Door frames were damaged all across the property when **Aristides** left; there was a terrible storm that day, and the wind howled as hard
  as the mightiest worg.

*I shall be taking care of urgent business elsewhere, but I expect the stead to be pristine for when master returns.
If anything goes wrong, please search not for tools in the lower chambers; they are flooded and dangerous. Just fix the door frame and let it be.*

*Each of these tasks shouldn't take more than two or three hours at most; by Twilight, everything should be done.*
