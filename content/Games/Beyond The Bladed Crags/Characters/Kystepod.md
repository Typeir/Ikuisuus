## **Traits**

**Loyal Symbiote.**  
The Lunar Kystepod is biologically tethered to Cerithol Lunami. While within 300 ft. of a Cerithol, it gains **advantage on all attack rolls** and **cannot be frightened**.

**Lunar Chitin.**  
The Kystepod's outer shell reflects spell energy in strange ways. When the Kystepod is targeted by a damaging spell that requires a saving throw, roll a d6. On a **6**, the spell rebounds at the original caster using the same attack or save DC.

**Five-Legged Skitter.**  
The Kystepod can move across ceilings, walls, and rough surfaces without needing to make checks. Its movement ignores difficult terrain caused by organic or fleshy terrain.

## **Actions**

**Multiattack.**  
The Lunar Kystepod makes two attacks: one with *Chitin Claws* and one with *Acidic Spear-Leg*.

**Chitin Claws.**  
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
**Hit**: 12 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed a **DC 13 Strength saving throw** or be knocked prone.

**Acidic Spear-Leg.**  
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
**Hit**: 14 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage. If the target is already prone, it suffers **maximum acid damage**.

## **Reactions**

**Spasm of Obedience.**  
*When a Cerithol Lunam within 300 ft. takes damage*:  
The Kystepod may move up to its full movement toward the Cerithol and immediately use *Chitin Claws* if a target is within range.

## **Description**

**Lunar Kystepods** are bloated, five-legged insectoid aberrations resembling a grotesque blend between a cockroach and a deep-buried tick. Created through parasitic grafting and lunar ichor rituals, they serve the **Cerithol Lunam** as guardians, scouts, and blood gatherers. Though they lack higher intelligence, their instincts are perfectly tuned to the will of the Cerithol. Their shells pulse with arcane scars, and their joints leak slow trails of acidic lymph that burn wherever they step. In groups, their speed and cruelty are overwhelming.
