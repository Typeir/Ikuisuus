### **Narvaez's Mighty Quiver**

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_  
_Greatsword (2d6 slashing, Heavy, Two-Handed, Special: Thrown, Graze)_

A quiver filled with **brutish, oversized greatswords**, crafted for **both melee and ranged devastation**. The quiver's enchantment allows the wielder to **hurl these blades with unnatural ease**, their trajectories crackling with residual energy.

Only **greatswords refitted for the quiver** can be used properly; **standard greatswords suffer a -5 penalty** to attack rolls unless modified (5gp & 1 hour of work by a skilled craftsman). **Magical greatswords cannot be stored in the quiver**—they are **forcefully ejected** if inserted.

#### **Weapon Mastery:**

- **Graze** – When you miss an attack with this weapon, the target still takes damage equal to your Strength modifier.

- **Mastery Ability – Thunderous Hurl (1/Short Rest, or PB/Short Rest if the wielder has mastery with Greatswords)**
  - As an **attack**, you may **hurl a greatsword** from the quiver at a target **within 30/60 ft**.
  - The blade releases a **thunderous blast**, forcing all creatures in a **5ft wide line** between you and the target to make a **Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + STR + PB)**.
  - **On failure,** they take **2d6 lightning damage**.
  - If the attack **hits**, the target takes an **additional 2d6 thunder damage** and their **speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn**.
  - **The hurled sword shatters upon impact**, becoming useless.

#### **Effects:**

- **Mighty Armament:**

  - Requires **20 Strength** or higher to wield effectively. If the requirement is not met, attacks are made at **disadvantage**.
  - Holds **up to 10 greatswords**, each weighing **6 lbs** (Quiver: **10 lbs**).
  - Drawn blades lose the **Heavy** and **Two-Handed** properties but gain **Thrown (30/60 ft) & Brittle** (breaks after impact).

- **Weapon Proficiency Override:**
  - While attuned, you **gain proficiency** with **Narvaez’s Mighty Quiver greatswords**, regardless of class.

### **Carranza's Great Épée**

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_  
_Rapier (1d8 piercing, Finesse, Special, Sap, Magical, Martial)_

A **colossal estoc** that boasts a **razor-thin but rigid blade**, designed for **both piercing strikes and parrying**. Its weight and design **allow for lethal counterattacks**, while its near-unbreakable form ensures it can parry even the strongest blows.

**Proper upkeep is required**—after **1d4+1 encounters**, if the blade is **not maintained**, it incurs a **-5 penalty to attack rolls** until restored. **Maintenance requires:**

- **10gp & 1 hour in a smithy**, or
- **8 hours of work by a proficient alchemist/tinker.**

#### **Weapon Mastery:**

- **Sap** – After hitting a creature with this weapon, their next attack roll before the start of your next turn is made at **disadvantage**.

- **Mastery Ability – Riposte Parry (1/Short Rest, or PB/Short Rest if the wielder has mastery with Rapiers)**
  - **As a reaction,** when a creature makes a melee attack against you but before the result is known, you may force them to **re-roll and take the lower result**.
  - If the attack **misses**, you may **immediately counterattack** with this weapon, dealing **an additional 1d8 lightning damage**.

#### **Effects:**

- **Mighty Armament:**

  - Requires **20 Strength** or higher to wield effectively. If the requirement is not met, attacks are made at **disadvantage**.

- **Deflecting Blade:**
  - If a **ranged attack** is made against you, you may attempt to **redirect it**. Roll a **Dexterity saving throw (DC = max(10 || DMG/2))**.
  - **On failure:** If the original attack **missed**, it is ignored. If it **hit**, you take normal damage.
  - **On success:** Choose a **new target within 30/60 ft**, rolling the attack and damage as though the original attacker had aimed for them.

---

### **Fatebound Fencers:**

- A creature attuned to either **Narvaez’s Mighty Quiver** or **Carranza’s Great Épée** **cannot attune to the other**.
- If the wielders of both weapons are **within 60ft of each other**, they gain the following benefits:
  - **Mighty Armament is ignored.**
  - **Narvaez’s Mighty Quiver greatswords count as 0 lbs for carrying capacity.**
  - **If the thread of fate is severed, these effects become permanent.**

---

### **Fated Demise:**

- If either wielder **falls unconscious or is slain**, the **living wielder is affected as follows**:
  - The fallen wielder’s weapon **seeks its counterpart** if within **600ft**, moving at **120ft per round** and **digging through terrain at 60ft per round** if needed.
  - The **remaining wielder automatically draws both weapons**, treating them as **light** weapons without consuming an action.
  - Gains:
    - **Advantage on all attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws** until unconscious.
    - **Immunity to all conditions except prone and exhaustion.**
    - **1 level of exhaustion per round.**
  - If the fallen wielder is **revived**, these effects **end**, but exhaustion remains.
  - The surviving wielder may **choose to unbind the weapons**, which:
    - **Removes all magic from the weapons** until **rebonded**.
    - **Inflicts 1 level of exhaustion** (if current exhaustion is below 3).
    - **Forces both wielders to unattune from the items.**
  - If the wielders are **more than 600ft apart**, the surviving wielder gains **1 exhaustion per day at dawn** until the bond is **severed or restored**.

---

### **Fated Retribution:**

- While under **Fated Demise**, the weapons gain the following effects:

#### **Narvaez’s Mighty Quiver – Thunderous Hurl (PB/Short Rest):**

- **As part of an attack,** replace an attack with a **lightning-charged hurl** of a greatsword.
- All creatures in a **5ft wide line** between you and the target must **roll a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + STR + PB)**.
- **On failure:** They take **2d6 lightning damage**. **Until the start of your next turn,** creatures crossing the line or starting their turn in it take an additional **2d6 lightning damage**.
- The **targeted creature** must also roll this save. If hit, they take an additional **2d6 thunder damage** and their **speed is reduced to 0** until the start of your next turn.

#### **Carranza’s Great Épée – Deflected Fate (PB/Short Rest):**

- When **deflecting a melee attack**, instead of counterattacking, every creature **within 5ft** of you must **roll a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + DEX + PB)**.

- **If deflecting a ranged attack**, the saving throw is made **with advantage**.

### **Lystig's Compressor** (Wondrous item)

- "Believe me when I say Gunpowder, Alchemical Precursors, and a metal pot is one hell of a combination. Don't ask me how, just believe me."

  - Lystig Curio, hobbit mercenary

  Forgoing a short rest, a compressor which requires 100gp in materials and proficiency with tinkers and alchemist's tools can be crafted and fitted into a gun. A gun fitted with **Lystig's Compressor** will turn into a magical object.

---

#### **The compressor has the following effects:**

- When it's crafted and fitted, or forgoing a short rest, the compressor can be fueled with 10gp worth of Alchemical materials in order to be able to cast cantrips along with a gunshot. Any melee spell attack component from a cantrip can be treated as a ranged attack component. Cantrips with ranged attack components can also be used. Only the gun attack has to be rolled, ignoring necessary attack rolls of other spells. If the spell incurs a saving throw, then the saving throw has to be rolled as normal, but its range is increased or decreased to that of the gun, provided they share targets or origin. If the spell has a range of self, it is ineligible, and if the range is touch, then it can be cast with the range of the weapon, provided they share targets. This feature can be used a number of times equal to the attuned creature's proficiency bonus per refuel.

- If the compressor is removed, both the gun and compressor break. The gun also has a +1 modifier to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it when using this feature.
