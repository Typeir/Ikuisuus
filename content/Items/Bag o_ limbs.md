### **Bag o’ Limbs**  

*Greathammer +1*  
*Wondrous weapon, very rare (requires attunement)*  

A disgusting, oversized sack of **preserved demon limbs**, grafted and stitched into a loosely humanoid form. Each strike carries the volatile essence of its contents — mangled hands, horns, tendrils, and organs — and channels the **residual elemental energies** from the demons they were torn from.

#### **Elemental Havoc**  

Whenever you hit a creature with **Bag o' Limbs**, roll a **d6** to determine a random elemental surge from the stored limbs. The target takes an additional **1d8 damage** of the rolled type, if the die lands on a 6, then rol two die and repeat, up to PB times:

| d6 | Elemental Effect |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | **Fire**         |  
| 2  | **Cold**         |  
| 3  | **Acid**         |  
| 4  | **Lightning**    |  
| 5  | **Poison**       |

#### **Mastery Skill – Limb Lash**  

*(1/Short Rest, or PB/Short Rest if wielder has Mastery with Greathammers)*  
When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can activate one of the bound limbs to lash out wildly at nearby enemies.  

- All creatures of your choice within **10 feet** of the target must make a **Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + Proficiency + STR modifier)** or take **2d6 bludgeoning + 2d8 random elemental damage** (roll on the table above).  
- On a success, they take half damage and are not knocked back.  
- On a failure, they are **pushed 10 feet away** from the target.

#### **Flavor Text:**  

This thing **reeks of incense, bile, and curdled demon sap**. Every time it moves, something squishes inside — sometimes it’s a knuckle, sometimes a lizard-like tongue. It’s a weapon **only a true Archivist’s agent** could wield with pride.
