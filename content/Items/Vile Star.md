# **Vile Star**  

*Rifle +2*  
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  
*Heavy, Ranged (60/120), Special*

A speck of truth, granted to those who've been inflicted vileness â€” so they may return it to the world. This rifle bears a cruel elegance, its biomechanical structure constantly pulsing with latent poison and radiant sorrow. Each shot echoes with judgment.
