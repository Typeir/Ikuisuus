# _Metabolic Furnace_

Wondrous item (Monstrous Graft), legendary, nonmagical

> “It’s awe-inspiring to see a beast able to wield metal-melting heat in absolute cold. It’s a dangerous challenge to face such a creature in combat — and an openly suicidal affair to fill your insides with its organs.”

This obscene monstrous graft dissolves your innards to fuel never-ending heat. Fuel the flame, consume the world.

### _Attaching the Graft_

Attaching this major monstrous graft to a humanoid requires an _8-hour surgical procedure_ using:

- _Alchemist’s Supplies, **Surgical Tools, and**Magical Healing_ (one healing spell per failed check to stabilize the patient)
- A surgeon with _proficiency in Medicine_ and the necessary tools.

During the procedure:

- The subject must succeed a _DC 10 Constitution saving throw_ before _every Medicine check_.
  - On a failure, the subject’s body _permanently rejects_ this graft.
  - If self-applied, they also _die instantly and violently_.

Each hour of the procedure requires a _DC 20 Medicine check_.

- On a failure, the subject takes _8d6 fire damage_ and must _repeat the check_.
- If interrupted, the graft is _rejected permanently_.

- This graft is _permanent_ until surgically removed (which destroys it).
- Only _one major monstrous graft_ can be attached at any time.
- It is _nonmagical_ in nature.

### _Fuel for the Flames_

The _Metabolic Furnace_ has _12 charges_.

You can _restore charges by consuming fresh corpses_ of:

- _Medium creature_: +1 charge
- _Large creature_: +2 charges
- _Huge creature_: +4 charges

> _Consuming a corpse_ takes _10 minutes per charge_ and involves a _nightmare-inducing digestion_ process.

### _Unstable Wrath_

While under the effects of Fuel for the Flames, you may unleash the furnace’s full potential:

*As a reaction when you take damage, you may \*\*activate Unstable Wrath, which lasts until*Fuel for the Flames ends.

_During Unstable Wrath:_

- You gain _immunity_ to _fire and cold damage_.
- Creatures that _touch you or hit you_ with melee attacks within 5 ft. take _10 fire damage_.
- _Once per turn, when you hit with an **unarmed or weapon attack, you deal an**extra 15 fire damage_.
- At the _start of each turn, you\*\*lose 3 charges_.
  - If you reach _0 charges, the effect\*\*ends immediately_.
- At the _end of the effect, you take\*\*4d6 acid damage_ per charge spent (this damage is unpreventable) as your _organs dissolve into sludge_.
