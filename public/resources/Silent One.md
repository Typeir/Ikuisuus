# **Silent One**  

Silent Ones are the warped remnants of Päivätär’s envy — beings birthed not by love or natural order, but by a divine desire to overshadow. Made from spite against the moon goddess Kuutar, their forms are uncanny and unsettling, but sometimes beautiful. Each and every single one of them a different beast altogether, some aberrant, some elegant, all of them spiteful in some way or another. The demons from the Hidden kingdom operate in contracts and social logic beyond that of the inhabitants of Damocles, which often lands them in secluded places, the wrong company, or worse
