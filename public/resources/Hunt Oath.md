# Paladin: Oath of The Hunt

The **Oath of the Hunt** is an ancient and solemn vow practiced by the **Golden Ones**, a religious-military collective within the Brume. Its origins lie in the distorted remnants of the **Päivätäri faith**, where **Päivätär**, the sun god, was once revered as the bringer of light, abundance, and vigilance.

The Golden Ones believe that the sun god Päivätär once gave warmth and bounty, but grew spiteful, and began to birth endless beasts into the world — life without balance, abundance without end. In an act of sacred necessity, the god was bound in harpoons and killed, an act both reverent and absolute.

The Hunt is the continuation of that pact — a murder-suicide between mortals and divinity. The world is now the hunters’ inheritance, but only if they are strong enough to end what needs ending.

## Tenets of The Hunt

A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of The Hunt **seared onto their upper arm**, burned in Brumean glyph-script:

- **Hone your weapons**  
  Your sword, like your instinct, must remain sharp. The Hunt tolerates no rust.

- **Hunt your mark**  
  Once the trail is taken, it must be followed. Mercy is hesitation, and hesitation is defeat.

- **Leave no egg behind**  
  The Hunt protects as much as it destroys. All things are born from cycle.

## Channel Divinity

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options:

### God-dragging Harpoon

For 1 hour, you can call on a tombsteel harpoon to point in the exact direction of your prey, it will bend around corners and find the most optimal path to it, given your available mobility options. While the harpoon is active, your climbing and swimming speed equal your walking speed, and they do not cost any extra movement.

### Bound to the earth

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can use a **bonus action** to manifest **tombsteel chains** that erupt from your weapon and wrap around the target.

- The attack deals **2d6 cold damage**.
- The target's speed becomes **0** until the end of their next turn.

---

## Aura of Interception

Starting at 7th level, your presence becomes a deterrent to flight.

- **Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you and your allies within the aura even if they Disengage**.
- When a creature affected by the area hits another creature with an opportunity attack, **its speed is reduced by 10 ft.** until the end of its next turn.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to **30 feet**.
